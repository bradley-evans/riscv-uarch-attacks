This project is being developed by Bradley Evans, a graduate student
at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bourns College
of Engineering, University of California-Riverside. This codebase was
created to satisfy requirements for the Master's Degree in Computer
Engineering at that university. Bradley Evans is advised by Prof.
Nael Abu-Ghazaleh.

This codebase is a portion of a thesis titled "The Attack Surface of
RISC-V Processors," currently unpublished (as of Aug 2020).
